#integer vector -- L is used to indicate that the preceding number
#should be stored as an integer

#shorthand (T/F)

#viewing the vectors

#in general, we can put any length of an index inside brackets
#for subsetting
indx <- c(1, 3, 7)

##Operations on vectors
vec.1 <- c(1, 3, 5)
vec.2 <- c(3.14, 1.49, 23)

#1 adding two vectors of the same length - entry-wise addition
vec.sum <- vec.1 + vec.2

#2 subtraction of two vectors
vec.diff <- vec.1 - vec.2

#3 entry-wise multiplication of two vectors
vec.mult <- vec.1 * vec.2

#4 entry-wise quotients of two vectors
vec.quotient <- vec.1 / vec.2

#5 exponentiation
vec.exp <- vec.1 ^ vec.2

###each of these can also be done for scalar operations
#example
vec.scalar <- vec.1 * 3

##dot products (x^T x)
vec.dot <- vec.1 %*% vec.2

##using standard functions on a vector
#squareroot of each value
vec.sqrt <- sqrt(vec.1)
vec.sqrt

#exponentiation
vec.exp2 <- exp(vec.1)

#-----------------------------
#summing every value in a single vector
vec1.sum <- sum(vec.1)

#average every value in a single vector
vec1.mean <- mean(vec.1)

#standard deviation of a vector
vec1.sd <- sd(vec.1)

#extremes of vector
vec1.min <- min(vec.1) #the minimum value
vec1.min.indx <- which.min(vec.1) #the index of the minimum value

vec1.max <- max(vec.1) #the maximum value
vec1.max.indx <- which.max(vec.1)


#---------------
#getting rid of NA's when doing operations
vec.3 <- c(99.7, 99.2, 91, NA, 92, NA)
#sum the vector ignoring NA's 
sum(vec.3, na.rm = TRUE)

#note if we don't use na.rm = TRUE, then we will get NA 
sum(vec.3)

#mean of vector ignoring NA's
mean(vec.3, na.rm = TRUE) #note - this will completely ignore
#NA from any calculation

#if you instead want to treat NA's as zero (for calculating a 
#mean)
sum(vec.3, na.rm = TRUE) / length(vec.3)
