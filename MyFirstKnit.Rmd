This is **my** first knit experience. First, *I* will get R to print out **Hello World,** and tell R to repeat my input command.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
print("Hello World")
```

Now, I'll do the same as above except I will tell R **not** to print out my input
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
print("Hello World")
```

Finally, I will generate 1000 observations from a N(0,1) distribution and print the histogram of the data with 100 bins.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
data <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(data, n = 100)
```
